# LED-Speed-Flash
An assembly language program that flashes an LED at four different speeds. The program starts out with the LED flashing at the slowest rate. Every time the debounced switch changes state, the speed will double until it reaches the maximum flash rate. The next time the switch changes state, it goes back to the slowest speed.
